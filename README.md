# GANs-for-Speech-Enhancement
Generative Adversarial Network implemented for the Time-Frequency based Speech Enhancement

This repository is an implementation of an ICASSP 2018 paper titled, 'TIME-FREQUENCY MASKING-BASED SPEECH ENHANCEMENT USING GENERATIVE
ADVERSARIAL NETWORK'.

This requires the features to be pre-extracted in a '.mat' file. Once the training, validation and testing features are extracted the attached 'training_gan.py' and 'testing_gan.py' files could be processed to get extracted enhanced speech features.
